## :bug: Issues and bugs

The easiest way to contribute is to report issues or bugs that you might find
while reading through the website. You can do this by creating a
[new](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/registers-guide/issues/new/choose) issue
on our GitHub repository.

## :pencil2: Adding or modifying content

If you would like to contribute content, please check out our
[guidebook](https://guidebook.seedcase-project.org/) for more specific details
on how we work and develop. It is a regularly evolving document, so is at
various states of completion.

To contribute to the `registers-guide`, you first need to install
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and
[justfile](https://just.systems/man/en/packages.html). We use uv and justfile to
manage our project, such as to run checks and previewing the website. Both the
uv and justfile documentation websites have a more detailed guide on using them,
but below are some simple instructions to get you started.

It's easiest to first [install
uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and then install
justfile with uv. Once you've installed uv, install justfile by running:

```bash
uv tool install rust-just
```

If you want to add R code, add these other tools too:

```bash
uv tool install air-formatter
uv tool install jarl-linter
```

We keep all our development workflows in the `justfile`, so you can explore it
to see what commands are available. To see a list of commands available, run:

```bash
just
```

As you contribute, make sure your changes will pass our checks by opening a
terminal so that the working directory is the root of this project
(`registers-guide/`) and running:

```bash
just run-all
```

When committing changes, please try to follow [Conventional
Commits](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-conventional-commits/) as
Git messages. Using this convention allows us to be able to automatically create
a release based on the commit message by using
[Commitizen](https://decisions.seedcase-project.org/why-semantic-release-with-commitizen/).
If you don't use Conventional Commits when making a commit, we will revise the
pull request title to follow that format. That's because we use squash merges
when merging pull requests, so all other commits in the pull request will be
squashed into one commit.
