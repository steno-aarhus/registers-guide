| Code system | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `sks` | Not listed here - see [DST's classification](https://medinfo.dk/sks/brows.php) |

- **`sks`:** The codes are hierarchical, so a prefix match selects a whole branch. That also makes it easy to select more than you meant: check how many characters your intended group actually needs before filtering with starts_with().

**Worth knowing:**

- **`c_opr`:** The SKS procedure code. Surgical codes start with K.
